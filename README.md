# Shaddy

Shaddy is a collection of shaders made for Kerbal Space Program, not to be confused with [Shabby](https://github.com/taniwha/Shabby), a shader asset bundle loader that you most likely also need to use to load Shaddy shaders :)

## Usage

### If you are a player...

Shaddy does not do anything by itself, it is designed to be used by other mods. If you run into any problem with the shader please feel free to report it as an issue.

### If you are a modder...

You may want to use [Shabby](https://github.com/taniwha/Shabby) to load Shaddy shaders to your parts. Alternatively, you can also use your own shader loader.
